Dr. Kim Peth, Strive Clinical Investigator.\n","[00:11.960 --> 00:17.540]  We will have a presentation portion of the call and then open up for Q&A where we will\n","[00:17.540 --> 00:23.280]  have other members of the Alumis team, John Schroer, CFO, and two senior leaders on the\n","[00:23.280 --> 00:28.480]  clinical team, Roman Rubio and Nick Lajakis.\n","[00:28.480 --> 00:33.760]  You'll be able to submit questions through the webcast platform in the Q&A section on\n","[00:33.760 --> 00:35.720]  the left side of your screen.\n","[00:35.720 --> 00:38.680]  I would now like to turn the call over to Martin Babler.\n","[00:38.680 --> 00:39.680]  Martin.\n","[00:39.680 --> 00:44.320]  Thank you, Terri, and good afternoon and good evening, and thank you all for joining us\n","[00:44.320 --> 00:45.320]  today.\n","[00:45.320 --> 00:50.760]  We're very excited to talk to you about SQ001 and the Phase II results that were presented\n","[00:50.760 --> 00:55.640]  this morning at a lay breaker at the AAD conference.\n","[00:55.640 --> 00:59.520]  Before we start, there are three things that I would like you to remember when we leave\n","[00:59.520 --> 01:01.520]  this call later today.\n","[01:01.520 --> 01:09.440]  The first one is that SQ001 is today the only sick-to-inhibitor that can safely achieve\n","[01:09.440 --> 01:14.780]  full-target inhibition at doses used and studied in psoriasis.\n","[01:14.780 --> 01:19.600]  The second one is that we are the first company who was able to test the hypothesis whether\n","[01:19.600 --> 01:24.880]  maximum target inhibition is beneficial for patient outcomes, and our data, as you will\n","[01:25.120 --> 01:30.880]  see that we presented this afternoon, clearly indicates that maximum inhibition provides\n","[01:30.880 --> 01:36.000]  a significant benefit long-term for patients, while incomplete inhibition leads to a drop\n","[01:36.000 --> 01:37.000]  in efficacy.\n","[01:37.000 --> 01:44.440]  And the third one is that SQ001 is the first oral small molecule drug that shows biologic-like\n","[01:44.440 --> 01:48.400]  efficacy in psoriasis patients.\n","[01:48.400 --> 01:53.680]  Now for our call today, I'm going to give you a quick introduction of Lumis, then we're\n","[01:53.680 --> 01:59.720]  going to turn it over to Dr. Papp, who we're very grateful to have here today, to share\n","[01:59.720 --> 02:05.760]  his slides and talk to us about what he presented this morning as a lay breaker at AAD.\n","[02:05.760 --> 02:09.880]  And then we're handing it over to Dr. Jurgen Draupa, who is our Chief Medical Officer,\n","[02:09.880 --> 02:15.400]  who gives you a little bit more information pre-clinically and early clinical data on\n","[02:15.400 --> 02:21.280]  SQ001, and I'll close the call with a couple of conclusions, and we'll follow that with\n","[02:21.280 --> 02:22.280]  a Q&A.\n","[02:24.200 --> 02:27.720]  Now let me first do just a quick introduction for Lumis.\n","[02:27.720 --> 02:32.600]  We're a three-year-old company, and we have a clinical asset currently and one that is\n","[02:32.600 --> 02:37.160]  about to be a clinical asset and the research platform behind that.\n","[02:37.160 --> 02:43.560]  Our lead asset, SQ001, is the first and only allosteric TIK2 inhibitor that can safely\n","[02:43.560 --> 02:48.720]  achieve maximum target inhibition for TIK2, and we believe that has significant benefits\n","[02:48.720 --> 02:49.720]  for patients.\n","[02:50.120 --> 02:55.880]  We believe that results in an improved risk-benefit ratio for the molecule and ultimately allows\n","[02:55.880 --> 02:59.960]  us to have a differentiated approach for patients.\n","[02:59.960 --> 03:06.080]  Given that it affects two key pathways in autoimmune diseases, both the IL-23 and the\n","[03:06.080 --> 03:11.400]  interferon pathway, we also believe that there is strong opportunity across many indications\n","[03:11.400 --> 03:15.240]  that are affected by those two pathways.\n","[03:15.240 --> 03:17.000]  Our second molecule is A5.\n","[03:17.000 --> 03:22.600]  This is a brain-penetrant TIK2 that has a one-to-one ratio between the plasma and the\n","[03:22.600 --> 03:28.600]  brain, so a really great brain penetration, and we're planning to study that in both neurodegenerative\n","[03:28.600 --> 03:33.800]  and neuroinflammatory diseases, and as we mentioned, this is going to go into the clinic\n","[03:33.800 --> 03:36.320]  in the first half of this year.\n","[03:36.320 --> 03:41.000]  Behind that, we're building a pipeline of proprietary products with a research organization\n","[03:41.000 --> 03:45.840]  that is quite experienced, and we're looking forward to putting additional molecules into\n","[03:45.840 --> 03:49.560]  the clinic in the next couple of years.\n","[03:49.560 --> 03:54.800]  The company is led by a very experienced team of leaders with a strong track record from\n","[03:54.800 --> 03:59.880]  both the scientific side and value creation side, and last but not least, we have a very\n","[03:59.880 --> 04:01.680]  strong investor syndicate.\n","[04:01.680 --> 04:07.240]  Now, what's different about Alumis and our approach?\n","[04:07.240 --> 04:12.800]  We call it the precision approach and capabilities, and you see that on this slide.\n","[04:12.800 --> 04:17.920]  We believe that to have the best risk benefit for patient, one has to really understand\n","[04:17.920 --> 04:24.600]  how the body reacts to certain target inhibitions and how really the drug interacts with the\n","[04:24.600 --> 04:31.400]  body, and so for us, the most important first step is to really understand the right target.\n","[04:31.400 --> 04:37.200]  TIK2 was selected early in the company's life because the mutations, the loss of function\n","[04:37.200 --> 04:42.760]  mutations such as the 1104 mutation, really helped us study not just the genomics but\n","[04:42.760 --> 04:49.440]  really understand how the inhibition of TIK2 could possibly affect patients of many, many\n","[04:49.440 --> 04:50.440]  different diseases.\n","[04:50.440 --> 04:56.200]  We also used that approach to understand the safety of TIK2 by looking at what actually\n","[04:56.200 --> 05:00.640]  happens to patients that have that loss of function mutation.\n","[05:00.640 --> 05:05.760]  The second one is the right molecule, and as you will see in the data and saw this morning,\n","[05:05.760 --> 05:12.680]  one of the key strengths of our TIK2 inhibitor is its pharmacologic and kinetic and pharmacodynamic\n","[05:12.680 --> 05:13.680]  profile.\n","[05:13.680 --> 05:19.560]  We have a very well-behaved molecule, and that has really helped us to fine-tune how\n","[05:19.560 --> 05:24.340]  to use this molecule in patients, and you'll see the results of that data today.\n","[05:24.340 --> 05:28.920]  One of the hallmarks of our study is that we have a beautiful dose response and a very,\n","[05:28.920 --> 05:32.680]  very tight decay that led to that.\n","[05:32.680 --> 05:34.120]  The third one is the right indication.\n","[05:34.480 --> 05:38.640]  As a company, we believe actually selecting your indication is critical, and I already\n","[05:38.640 --> 05:44.360]  mentioned that we did a lot of work around TIK2 and the diseases that it might affect.\n","[05:44.360 --> 05:48.380]  In our case, we selected psoriasis because we believed that it would be the best way\n","[05:48.380 --> 05:53.320]  to understand how our molecule stacks up against other molecules in the class.\n","[05:53.320 --> 06:00.920]  We selected SLE because it's the first and best way to find out how this molecule affects\n","[06:00.920 --> 06:04.880]  the interferon pathway and not just IL-23 pathway.\n","[06:04.880 --> 06:10.200]  We chose uveitis because that's an indication where we believe, given its association with\n","[06:10.200 --> 06:14.440]  many other diseases, that we'll learn not just about uveitis but other diseases potentially\n","[06:14.440 --> 06:15.440]  as well.\n","[06:15.440 --> 06:20.280]  In terms of the right endpoint, one of the things you saw today is that we didn't just\n","[06:20.280 --> 06:25.600]  look at the 12-week data, but it was important for us to understand also how this molecule\n","[06:25.600 --> 06:28.120]  affects patients over time.\n","[06:28.120 --> 06:33.160]  We designed a Phase II program that had included a long-term follow-up for the patients, and\n","[06:33.160 --> 06:38.880]  I think the results that we see now really are very insightful for us to see in the context\n","[06:38.880 --> 06:41.840]  of our TIK2 interference in life.\n","[06:41.840 --> 06:46.200]  The right patient is an important aspect for all of us, and finding the right therapy for\n","[06:46.200 --> 06:48.200]  the right patient is critical.\n","[06:48.200 --> 06:53.520]  We are spending a lot of time analyzing a lot of the patient's individual data, their\n","[06:53.520 --> 06:56.400]  genomes, their genomics, etc., etc.\n","[06:56.400 --> 07:00.640]  And the work that we have done around TIK2 actually has led to us finding a biomarker\n","[07:00.640 --> 07:03.840]  that is unique to TIK2 and is proprietary.\n","[07:03.840 --> 07:08.000]  And last but not least, we believe that the future in therapy...\n"]}]}]}
